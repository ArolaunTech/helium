Helium uses the ```zip.js``` (https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/zip.js) library for reading zip files, which is also licensed under the BSD 3-Clause license. 

It also uses the ```scratch-sb1-converter``` (https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-sb1-converter) library to support Scratch 1 files, which is again licensed under the BSD 3-Clause license. The library was compiled into vanilla JS using ```esbuild```.
